I would like to remove postList and just use the postList contained within each account, as there are duplicate posts stored for little reason.


Account.ValidHandle()
Change !handle.matches("(\\S)+") (non-whitespace character) to just handle.matches("(\\s)+") (white-space character)
Change function name from Account.ValidHandle() to validateHandle()

Can you compare primitive values with '=='? (Pretty sure yes)

Change post.getPostID() to post.getID()

SocialMedia.removeAccount(int id)
Iterating over postList will have the same number of operations as iterating over each account and then iterating over all of the accountPosts.
Change:
for (Post p:postList){...}

to:
for(Post p : accountToDelete.getPosts()){
    deletePost(p.getID());
    ...
}
Changed Account.getAccountPosts() to Account.getPosts().
Added clearEndorsements() - this empties the endorsement arraylist associated with the post.


Are our endorsements transitive?? if B endorses A and C endorses B, then C should point to A not B.


createPost(String handle, String message){}
would prefer an explicit method to add a post to AccountPosts. addPost(Post p) method.
Don't need postingAccount.incrementPostCount(), as the postCount is just the size of the accountPosts ArrayList.

endorsePost(String handle, int id){}
Shouldn't the postToEndorse's account be the one that the setEndorsementCountUpToDateToFalse() is called on
